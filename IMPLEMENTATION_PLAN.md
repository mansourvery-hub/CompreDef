# CompreDef — Implementation Plan

Product status: **shipped and stable (v1.2.18)**. Every slice below
is COMPLETE, tested, and released. New work enters only via the
Backlog at the bottom — never by silent scope creep mid-session.

## Shipped slices (all COMPLETE)

- **T1 — Install-time dictionary indexing** (folder/ZIP, SQLite
  cache, signature + renderer-version invalidation)
- **T2 — Definition generation** (density argmax scoring with
  maximal fallback; most-kanji tie-break, encounter order beyond that)
- **T12 — Dictionary-picker audit.** Offline grading rig for the
  picker: `debug/audit_picker.py` captures every dictionary's
  definitions for each card of the real 11-note deck
  (`My Life Decks::Japanese::anki-japanese-template`) under 3 profiles
  (mine/beginner/native) x 2 sources (local dictionaries/Yomitan) into
  `tests/fixtures/picker_audit.json`, renders
  `debug/reports/picker_audit_<ts>.html` (winners matrix + collapsed
  rankings), and `test_picker_audit_strict` (Ring 1) pins the frozen
  winners plus human-grade agreement.
- **T13 — Density scoring + swappable picker.**
  Length-normalized comprehension density replaces raw-sum argmax
  (succinct 90%-known beats 20-paragraph 5%-known); `picker.py` owns
  gather/filter/rank/pick behind a `PickerStrategy` interface
  (`DensityPicker` default, `LegacySumPicker` for A/B via the
  `picker_strategy` config key); algorithm + equations documented in
  ARCHITECTURE.md and the wiki; every definition ranked with one
  logic, dictionary order never decides.
- **T3 — Learner knowledge snapshot** (first-field extraction,
  mastered ≥ 365d / seen > 0, Scope-bounded, session-cached)
- **T4 — Deck Scope + quick-fix** (subdeck expansion, ANY-card
  membership, fail-closed empty scope, add-deck dialog)
- **T5 — Multi-type field targets + inference** (per-type mappings,
  auto-inference fallback, legacy single-type compat)
- **T6 — Editor integration** (toolbar button, Tab-to-Generate via
  unfocus hook, Add-window deck resolution, single-flight guard)
- **T7 — Browser bulk generation** (menu/context actions, per-note
  failure isolation, summary tooltips)
- **T8 — Learner Knowledge dialog** (Overview stat cards, Kanji/Vocab/
  Mature-Notes tabs, sorting, filter, Browser provenance search,
  non-modal singleton, payload cache)
- **T9 — Yomitan API source** (bridge installer, keepalive,
  anti-zombie shutdown, nonce pairing, nested timeouts)
- **T10 — Yomitan-fidelity rendering** (structured content, ruby,
  `data-sc-*`, per-dictionary CSS scoping, style sanitization,
  ZIP ≡ folder parity)
- **T11 — Release pipeline** (regression gate, packaging + verify,
  GitHub Release, AnkiWeb upload watch, local auto-install)
- **T14 — Scoring fat removal.** Scoring runs on cleaned text:
  tagged boilerplate (thesaurus `$c-ruigo` sections, `data-sc-hinshi`
  POS tags) stripped via a depth-counted HTML parser, headword
  self-mentions excluded (multi-char terms only), shared
  `scoring_base_text` for kanji + vocab paths.
- **T15 — Human grading verdicts.** All 54 ★ picks (11 words x
  2 sources x 3 profiles, minus empty cases) graded correct by the
  owner; agreement pinned at 54/54 by `test_picker_audit_strict`.

## Backlog

Empty. All 15 slices shipped; new work enters here per request.

## Working agreements (from experience)

- One user request = one workstream; finish, verify, release.
- Docs change with behavior in the same commit (QUALITY.md rule
  touched ⇒ TEST_STRATEGY.md row touched).
- Debug-only tooling (`debug/`) never ships (`build.sh` packages
  root `*.py` + assets only) and never runs in CI.
- Root-level scratch files (`debug_*.py`, `*.backup`, `*_original.py`)
  must never be committed — they get packaged into the `.ankiaddon`.
